# PRE-WORK CHECKLIST - MANDATORY

## ⚠️ STOP - READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

### Before typing ANY command or making ANY edit:

1. [ ] Run: `git branch`
2. [ ] If output shows `* main` or `* master`:
   - **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
   - Run: `git checkout -b feature/description`
   - Then proceed with work
3. [ ] If already on feature branch (e.g., `* feature/something`):
   - ✅ Proceed with work

### Branch Naming:
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes  
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### NEVER:
- ❌ Commit to main
- ❌ Push to main
- ❌ Make changes while on main branch

### REMEMBER:
**"Even for small changes, ALWAYS use feature branches"**

This checklist must be reviewed before EVERY coding session.
